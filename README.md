# BroncoATS
Tailored to the Cal Poly Pomona Discord server, BroncoATS is a Discord bot that uses an ATS (applicant tracking system) to parse through resumes and gives feedback on them, attempting to mimick ATS that real employers would use.
## Dev Setup
1. Clone repo.
2. Run npm install.
3. If you are developer, ask another developer for `config.json`.
4. Put `config.json` into the source folder.
5. And now you're set up!
## Running the bot
- `npm run start` will start up the bot, in which it will run off your computer.
- `npm run refresh` will refresh the bot if you made changes to it.
